# Contributing to PVM

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

Please read this guide before creating an issue or submitting a pull request.


## Etiquette

This project is maintained by developers who give their free time to build and improve it.
Please be respectful when raising issues or submitting pull requests — criticism is fine, but keep it constructive.

The maintainers will review contributions to ensure they improve the project. Respect their decisions, even if your submission is not accepted.


## Submitting Issues

Before opening an issue, please make sure you have:

- Attempted to replicate the problem, to confirm it wasn’t a coincidental incident.
- Checked that the feature request or bug is not already present.
- Looked at the open and closed issues to see if your problem has already been reported or solved.
- Verified in the Pull Requests tab that there isn’t already a fix in progress.

If all the above checks out, feel free to open an issue with:

- A clear description of the problem or feature.
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
- Expected vs. actual behavior.
- Environment details (OS, PHP version, etc.).


## Submitting Pull Requests

When submitting a PR, please ensure that you:

- Do not submit whitespace-only changes.
- Make sure the feature or fix doesn’t already exist.
- Verify there’s no other PR already in progress for the same thing.
- Run all existing tests and confirm they pass.


## Requirements

If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
